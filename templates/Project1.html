                        This project classifies a given photograph to either a dog, cat or neither. The
                        algorithm has an accuracy of 87%. This leaves a 13% margin of error, resulting
                        in incorrect classifications. The project is posted on Github due to size
                        restrictions as I am currently using Heroku free account which limits me to
                        500mb and tensorflow takes 400mb to host alone. The ReadMe file provided will
                        aid you in the set and installation of the project, please read this file
                        accordingly
                    </p>

                            that contains Dogs Vs Cats model and how to build app </a>

                        The model used is provided by keras. It is been trained on over 10 000 images. The
                        model was enhanced further though thousands of cat and dog images to impove the models
                        detection capabilities. Basic statistics was is also incorporated to determin the
                        range of predictions i.e dog, cat or neither(note the model was trained with portrait
                        photographs of dogs and cats therefore an uploaded photo must a portrait)

                        You can learn how to use and create models and pretrained models from the tensor flow
                        website. This projected used a pretrained model then improved it.
