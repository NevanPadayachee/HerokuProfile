                        Classifies if the given picture is a Dog, Cat or Neither. Note that the accuracy of
                        this model is 87% so it can predict wrong values. The project is posted on git hub.
                        It could not have been run on Heroku as tensorflow is too large(400mb) and as a
                        free account holder I have 500mb to work with. Please read the ReadMe file in the
                        project folder as it will help you run the file with the necessary requirements

                        The model used is one from keras trained over 10 000 images, then trained on
                        thousands of cat and dog images to improve the model on cat and dog detection.
                        Then used basic statistics to determine the range of prediction, it being a
                        cat, dog or neither.
