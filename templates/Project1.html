                        Classifies if the given picture is a Dog, Cat or Neither. Note that the accuracy of
                        this model is 87% so it can predict wrong values. The upload may take a min as the
                        upload is predicting the picture uploaded and deleting the picture as well

                        The model used is one from keras trained over 10 000 images, then trained on
                        thousands of cat and dog images to improve the model on cat and dog detection.
                        Then used basic statistics to determine the range of prediction of it being a
                        cat, dog or neither.

                        You can learn how to use models and pretrained models from the tensor flow website.
