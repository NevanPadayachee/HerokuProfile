                        The data was obtained in a survey of students math courses in secondary school.
                        The data was collected from two schools, Gabriel Pereira and Mousinho da Silverira
                        It contains a lot of interesting social, gender and study information about students.
                        The following diagram shows the correlation between many of the important datasets.

                    <p>
                        There is Positive correlation between parents education and final result
                        as well as a Positively strong correlation between the first two tests and the final
                        test.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There is negative correlation between age and the final result,a negative correlation
                        between free time and the final test, a negative correlation between travel time and
                        final test and a negative correlation between going out There is a negatively strong
                        correlation between failures and final result.

                    <h3>The conclusion</h3>
                    <p>
                        Students whose parents have studied past secondary school have a slightly higher chance
                        of doing well in math. Students whose travel time is high, have more free time and have
                        failed classes multiple times have a lower chance of doing well in math.
                    </p>

                        The datasets were obtained from kaggle where you can get many free datasets and can enter
                        many kaggle competitions orientated around data science and data analytics. The machine
                        learning model was created with the help of the tensorflow website.
