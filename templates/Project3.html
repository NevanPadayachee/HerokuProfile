                        This Project searches of given item and searches for the item on amazon. Gets the first
                        page of results and stores it on a csv file for easy access. The stored data is the
                        description of the item, price, rating and link to the product for purchase.

                        This project can be altered to incorporate multiple pages and websites for a more wider
                        range of products and prices.

                        The Web Scraper was created using two libraries Beautiful Soup and Selenium. Selenium
                        was used to get the web data and Beautiful Soup was used to manipulate the data.
